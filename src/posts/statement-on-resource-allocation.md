In light of Warren County’s ongoing budget deficit, it is more critical than ever to ensure that every available resource is being used strategically and effectively. As a member of the school board, I will work to guarantee that we are maximizing the impact of every dollar to drive student achievement.

We must prioritize targeted support for students who are struggling in the classroom—ensuring they have the tools, attention, and interventions necessary to succeed. At the same time, investing in the professional growth and development of our teachers and staff is essential to retaining talent, improving instruction, and meeting our district’s long-term goals.

Upgrading outdated technology is no longer optional, it is a vital investment in preparing our students for the future. Modern tools and resources are essential for engaging instruction and equitable access to learning.

I am committed to working year-round with the Board of Supervisors to advocate for sustainable, full funding of public education. Our students, teachers, and community deserve nothing less.
