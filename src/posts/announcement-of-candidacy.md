My name is Sara Jones and I am pleased to announce my candidacy for the Warren County School Board seat in the Happy Creek District.

I’m running for school board to strengthen the education and increase the opportunities for growth for all children of this community. Our students, staff, and parents need someone to advocate for them and support their needs, and that is what I plan to do. I want a safe and healthy environment in all of our schools not just for the students but for the staff as well. I hope that my non-partisan views can help bridge the divide that opposing opinions have created and keep the focus on protecting and improving the public education provided to the children of Warren County.

I am a lifelong resident of Warren County, and a proud graduate of Warren County High School. I met my husband here and we have 2 sons who attend Warren County Public Schools. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Administration with a focus in Human Resources Management, which I earned from Western Governors University. 

I am passionate about the public education system, not just for my own children but for all children in Warren County. The students of this community deserve to have a positive learning environment where they feel supported and can thrive. I strongly believe a good education is one of the best things we can give our children and I stand by that belief and promise to focus on improvement and growth in the education provided by Warren County Public Schools.
