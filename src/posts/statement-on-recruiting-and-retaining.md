In recent years, Warren County has faced serious challenges in attracting and retaining high-quality educators. While we know there are many factors that influence a person’s decision to join or stay in a profession, it’s essential that we better understand the root causes of our high teacher turnover rate, and take meaningful action to address these issues.

With my educational background in human resources, I bring both the knowledge and dedication to help identify and remove the barriers that are driving talented educators away. I will prioritize listening directly to our teachers and staff, creating opportunities for honest, confidential feedback to ensure every voice is heard, especially those who may not feel comfortable speaking out publicly.

I am committed to working with educators and leadership to strengthen teacher support, improve workplace culture, and make Warren County Public Schools a destination where passionate, well-trained professionals choose to build their careers. Together, with a new superintendent and renewed vision, we can create an environment where educators feel valued, supported, and empowered to help every student grow, succeed, and achieve their dreams.
