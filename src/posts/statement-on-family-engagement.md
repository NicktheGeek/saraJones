When families are engaged, students thrive. That’s why strong, consistent communication is key to building meaningful family involvement in our schools. I believe we can do more—and do better—when it comes to keeping families informed and connected.

As a school board member, I will champion clear, accessible communication through a variety of platforms including the WCPS website, email, social media, and paper forms, so no family is left out. I plan to introduce a monthly district-wide newsletter led by our superintendent and their team, featuring important updates, upcoming events, policy changes, and insights into the challenges and progress of our schools.

In addition, I’ll encourage each school to share their own monthly or bi-monthly newsletters to spotlight what's happening inside their classrooms and school communities.

Together, by opening up the lines of communication between parents, teachers, and administrators, we can strengthen our schools and help every child succeed.
